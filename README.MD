# Stekloplastik
## A rewrite of my recent Develnext project to WinForms
Here you can see all source and progress of port. <br/>
<br/>
Original project is localized on Russian. This port will use English language as main localization, maybe in the future I'll add Russian back too. <br/>
You can check out OG project [here](https://github.com/localwhale20/Stekloplastik-DN)
